<dd>Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. Population: just under 20,000. It’s where we call home. It’s where we create all of our delicious dips, dressings, and salads. Simply put, it’s where the goodness happens.

Tacámbaro, Michoacán, Mexico. Population: just above 25,000. That’s our second home. In the groves and sunshine where we are closest to the avocados. It’s where we can easily compost the avocado pits and skins back into the earth. It’s where all the guacamole goodness happens.
